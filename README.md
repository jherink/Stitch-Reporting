Create highly customizable reports using HTML &amp; CSS in .NET

<hr />

### Why HTML?
<ul>

<li>By styling through CSS & HTML you can create highly customizable reports!</li>

<li>By creating reports in an HTML format they are easily embeddable in web pages.
Also many UI frameworks provide browser controls for your applications
allowing you to render Stitch reports without the need for third party viewers.</li>

<li>HTML can be exported to other document formats like PDF or DOCX.</li>

<li>HTML is parsable using an XML parser, which many frameworks support, allowing
you to mine data from these reports if needed.</li>

</ul>

### CSS

Stitch uses [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp), currently version 2.84, for it's default styling.  As a user you have access to all the CSS styling available in W3.CSS in your Stitch elements.
